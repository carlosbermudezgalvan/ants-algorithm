# 🐜 Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Implementation in Java

## 🎯 Project Focus: Algorithmic Demonstration

This repository contains a **clear, functional Java implementation** of the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** metaheuristic.

ACO is a probabilistic technique used for solving computationally challenging **combinatorial optimization problems** (often classified as NP-hard). Key applications of this project include demonstrating solutions for these types of problems, such as the famous **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**.

**The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate:**

1.  A foundational understanding of **swarm intelligence** principles.
2.  The ability to accurately translate complex **metaheuristic algorithms** into working code.
3.  **Conceptual clarity** in the modeling of the ACO optimization process.

## ⚙️ Core Technical Features

The implementation models the foraging behavior of ant colonies to find optimal paths:

* **Pheromone Management:** Mechanisms for pheromone deposition, evaporation, and influence on path selection probability.
* **Heuristic Information:** Integration of local heuristic data (e.g., distance between nodes) to guide the ants' movement.
* **Solution Representation:** Effective graph modeling for the problem space (e.g., cities/nodes).
* **Iterative Optimization:** Control structure for running multiple optimization cycles to find near-optimal solutions.

## 🚀 Execution

The project is designed to run out-of-the-box, initiating the simulation and optimization process.

### Prerequisites

* Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

### Steps

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Open the project in your Java IDE.
3.  Execute the main application file:
    * `App.java`
4.  The application will initialize the environment (ants, food sources, graph) and begin the iterative optimization process.
